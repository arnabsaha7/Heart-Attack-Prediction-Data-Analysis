# Heart Attack Analysis with Python and PySpark

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of heart attack data using Python and PySpark. The project aims to explore patterns, risk factors, and predictive modeling for heart attacks based on a dataset.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning using PySpark for efficient handling of large datasets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends in heart attack data.
- Machine Learning models for predicting the likelihood of a heart attack.
- Visualization of results to facilitate a better understanding of the analysis.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- PySpark
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)

## Installation
